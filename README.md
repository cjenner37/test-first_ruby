in 02_calculator, I didn't do the third part, SUM, because IDK how. 

in 03_simon_says, I couldn't figure out "repeat", and what was after seemed trivial, so I copied the code following "shout" from an Odin user's solution

I was supposed to complete 04_pig_latin, 08_book_titles, and 09_timer, but I figured I'd come back to it. Hope it works out.
